# Challenge 1: Document Processing and Vectorized Search

**Expected Duration:** 60 minutes

## Introduction
Welcome to Challenge 1! In this challenge, you'll build a comprehensive document processing and search system using Azure AI services. This foundational challenge demonstrates how to process insurance documents (both text and images), create vectorized search capabilities, and prepare the knowledge base that will power all subsequent AI agent implementations.

## What are we building?
In this challenge, we will create a complete document processing and vectorized search system that forms the backbone of our insurance AI agent ecosystem:

- **Document Upload System**: Azure Blob Storage integration for secure document management
- **Multimodal Processing Pipeline**: GPT-4-1-mini powered text and image processing capabilities  
- **OCR Extraction System**: Advanced text extraction from insurance claim images
- **Vectorized Search Index**: Azure AI Search with integrated vectorization for semantic search
- **Hybrid Search Capabilities**: Combined keyword, vector, and semantic search functionality

This system will serve as the knowledge foundation for all agents in subsequent challenges, enabling them to access and query insurance policies, claims, and statements intelligently.

## Data Structure Overview

Your challenge includes comprehensive insurance data across three categories:

| Data Category | Files | Purpose |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| **Claims Data** (`data/images/`) | `crash1.jpg`, `crash2.jpg`, `crash3.jpg`, `crash4.jpg`, `crash5.jpg` | Vehicle accident documentation for OCR processing |
| **Policy Data** (`data/policies/`) | `commercial_auto_policy.md`, `comprehensive_auto_policy.md`, `high_value_vehicle_policy.md`, `liability_only_policy.md`, `motorcycle_policy.md` | Insurance policy documents for text processing and policy validation |
| **Claim Statements** (`data/statements/`) | `crash1_front.jpeg`, `crash1_back.jpeg`, `crash2_front.jpeg`, `crash2_back.jpeg`, `crash3_front.jpeg`, `crash3_back.jpeg`, `crash4_front.jpeg`, `crash4_back.jpeg`, `crash5_front.jpeg`, `crash5_back.jpeg` | Written statements (front and back) corresponding to each claim for comprehensive analysis |


## Document Processing after the Generative AI Wave

Generative AI has transformed document processing from rigid template-based systems to intelligent, understanding-based approaches. Modern models process text, images, and complex layouts simultaneously, eliminating separate pipelines for different content types.

**Key Advantages:**
- Context-aware extraction without predefined templates
- Unified processing of multimodal content (text, images, tables)
- Natural language queries instead of fixed extraction fields
- Minimal training requirements using pre-trained foundation models

**For Insurance:** Complex documents—policies, claim photos, handwritten statements, invoices—can now be processed in a single pipeline, understanding both textual terms and visual damage assessments together.

When building document processing systems today, selecting the right AI models is crucial for achieving accurate and efficient results. Here are the primary options available for processing insurance documents:

### <img src="images/azure-document-intelligence-logo.png" alt="Azure Document Intelligence" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Azure Document Intelligence

[Azure Document Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) (formerly Form Recognizer) is an AI service that provides advanced document processing capabilities using multimodal foundation models. Unlike traditional OCR tools, Document Intelligence uses machine learning to understand documents in a more comprehensive way:

- **Prebuilt Models**: Ready-to-use models for invoices, receipts, ID cards, insurance documents, and other common forms
- **Custom Models**: Train models on your specific document types for tailored extraction accuracy
- **Layout Analysis**: Understand document structure including tables, paragraphs, selection marks, and document hierarchy
- **Key-Value Extraction**: Automatically identify and extract field-label pairs from forms
- **Multi-Page Support**: Process complex multi-page documents with sophisticated layout understanding
- **High Accuracy OCR**: Extract printed and handwritten text with high precision across multiple languages
- **Azure Integration**: Native integration with Azure AI services, security, compliance, and Azure AI Search

Azure Document Intelligence is particularly powerful for insurance scenarios where structured forms (claims, policies) and unstructured documents (handwritten statements, accident reports) need to be processed together. Its prebuilt insurance document models can extract policy numbers, claim amounts, dates, and other critical fields automatically.
